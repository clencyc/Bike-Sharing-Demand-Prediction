# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

This project aims to predict bike rental demand using historical data. The dataset includes features such as weather conditions, time, and season, which are used to train a machine learning model to forecast bike usage.

## Project Structure

- **/Project**: Contains all the project files, including data, scripts, and models.
  - `data`: Raw and processed datasets.
  - `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training.


## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations to understand trends and relationships in the data.
- **Model Training**: Training machine learning models to predict bike demand.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like RMSE.

## Results

The model achieved a competitive score on the Kaggle competition for the Bike Sharing Demand dataset. Below is a visualization of the model's performance:
